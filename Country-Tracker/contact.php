                <h4>How do I add a country?</h4>
                <p>First, you need to open the country's page. Then, you can either set the country as visited, as your
                    home, or bookmark it.</p>
                <h4>Does Country Tracker work offline?</h4>
                <p>Yes it does, however, country informations won't be loaded. You'll still be able to manage the
                    countries because the list is on your phone.</p>
                <h3 class="subtitle-yellow help-group-titles"><a id="help-more"></a>More Questions & Answers</h3>
                <h4>Is there an iPad app? Mac app?</h4>
                <p>Yes, there is a Country Tracker app for your iPad and Mac. Your countries will automatically sync
                    between all the devices, for free.</p>
                <h4>Is there an Android app?</h4>
                <p>Not yet. Because we are a tiny self-funded team we must focus our efforts for now. Depending on how
                    fast and how well iOS succeeds will determine how quickly we can work on Android. So support us by
                    trying it on your iPad or Mac, or telling friends with iPhones!</p>
                <h4>What happens if I install Country Tracker on more than one device?</h4>
                <p>Country Tracker syncs between your devices, being it iPhones or iPads. No need to log in to an
                    account, simply using the same apple id on all your devices is required to sync the countries
                    between the devices.</p>
                <h4>How's my data used?</h4>
                <p>Country Tracker does not keep or share any information about you, your device or your countries. We
                    don't have tracking SDKs. We don't share or sell any data.</p>
