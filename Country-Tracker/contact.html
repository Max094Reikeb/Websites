                <h4>How do I add a flight?</h4>
                <p>There are 3 ways: Manually search, forward your email itinerary, or sync with TripIt. Manual search
                    supports searching by flight number or the route into the search field,
                    selecting the date and tapping the flight you were
                    looking for. Or you can set up email import to easily
                    forward your flights via email or you can set up TripIt
                    Sync to import all your flights from your TripIt
                    account.</p>
                <h4>Does Flighty work offline - like on a plane?</h4>
                <p>Yes, Flighty does work when you are offline. In this
                    case, the data you see is based on the latest
                    information Flighty received while you where last
                    online. The offline mode is indicated in the status
                    field of the flight details with the phrase “Offline
                    Mode · Estimating all times”.</p>

                    More Questions & Answers
                </h3>
                <h4>Is there an iPad app? Mac app?</h4>
                <p>Yes, there is a Flighty app for your iPad and Mac. Your flights
                    will automatically sync between all the devices, for free, without an account.</p>
                <h4>Is there an Android app?</h4>
                <p>
                    Not yet. Because we are a tiny self-funded team we must focus our efforts for now. Depending on how
                    fast and how well iOS succeeds will determine how quickly we can work on Android. So support us by
                    trying it on your iPad or Mac, or telling friends with iPhones! Email

                <h4>What happens if I install Flighty on more than one
                    device?</h4>
                <p>Flighty syncs between your devices, being it iPhones or
                    iPads. No need to log in to an account, simply using the
                    same apple id on all your devices is required to sync
                    the flights between the devices. Note: settings are not
                    synced because you might want to decide on your own
                    which notifications you receive on which device.</p>
                <h4>What is the dashed line on the map?</h4>
                <p>This is where you inbound aircraft is coming from. It's
                    the flight your aircraft flies right before yours, so
                    you can see where your plane is coming from.</p>
                <h4>Why is my flight's data missing or inaccurate?</h4>
                <p>Although we use the best data in the world and many
                    different sources to cover as many flights as possible,
                    there are still over 100 thousand flights per day and
                    sometimes your flight may not have complete data. Please
                    report these instances so we can continue to improve
                    coverage.</p>
                <h4>How is my data used?</h4>
                <p>Basically - to improve Flighty but never to share with
                    anyone else. Flighty does not keep or share any
                    information about you, your device or your flights. We
                    don't have tracking SDK's like Facebook or Google. We
                    don't share or sell any data - we keep as little as
                    possible to serve you well.</p>
                <h3 class="subtitle-yellow help-group-titles">
                    <a id="terminology"></a>
                    Common Terminology
                </h3>
                <h4>Inbound Plane</h4>
                <p>When you take a flight, your plane comes from another
                    flight right before yours, that is the inbound plane.
                    Pro flyers watch that plane carefully, since if it's
                    late... you have to wait for it and you will be late.
                    Often times even if the airline has not delayed the
                    flight yet.</p>
                <h4>Gate Departure</h4>
                <p>When the plane and the jetway gate disconnect. Usually
                    simultaneous with the airplane door closing. Hopefully
                    the plane pushes back from the gate shortly after, but
                    sometimes Captains will sit at the gate for a moment -
                    this is still considered a gate departure since the
                    jetway left the airplane.</p>
                <h4>Take Off</h4>
                <p>When the plane wheels leave the ground. Duh, right? Well
                    it's not that easy, specifically, this is not departure.
                    It is commonly confused, but departure is gate
                    departure. This is why we never say “Departure” alone.
                    We always say “Gate Departure”.</p>
                <h4>Landing</h4>
                <p>When the plane wheels touch down on the ground. Never
                    “arrival” or anything to do with arriving.</p>
                <h4>Gate Arrival</h4>
                <p>Commonly called “arrival” but that's confusing since it
                    could mean arrival at the airport. Arriving always means
                    at the gate, but this is confusing, so we always say
                    “Gate Arrival” just to make sure.</p>
                <h4>Diverted</h4>
                <p>When a plane is redirected from it originally planned
                    destination to a different destination. Commonly due to
                    bad weather at the arrival airport.</p>
                <h4>Recovery</h4>
                <p>The flight after a diverted flight, that gets the
                    passengers from the diverted location to the originally
                    planned airport. Most times the same plane is used for
                    the Recovery flight, but not always, it could be hours
                    later, with a different plane, from a different gate.</p>
                <h4>Long Haul</h4>
                <p class=no-spacing>The term is used to designate long distance flights, but
                    what is the minimum “long distance”? Wikipedia states
                    4,100 km, while Europeans commonly use 4,000 km, and
                    American use 4,800 km plus any flights LAX-NYC.</p>
                <p>At Flighty we use 3,950 km measured as a great circle.
                    This allows all LAX-NYC flights to be counted for
                    Americans and as a bonus Europeans get an extra 50 km of
                    leeway.</p>
